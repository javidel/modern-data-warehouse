## Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to Oracle Cloud and the unique capabilities of Oracle's Autonomous Data Warehouse.

### Who Should Use This Workshop?

Everyone can benefit from doing the exercises listed in this guide: technical experts (data warehouse architects to database administrators), business users who want to focus on extracting meaning and insight from their own data, along with data scientists who want to build machine learning models within the context of a data warehouse project.


### Business Case: Oracle E-shop
To make this workshop as realistic as possible, let us introduce the business scenario you will use during this workshop - Oracle E-shop.

## Welcome to Oracle E-shop
Oracle E-shop is a fictitious e-commerce company. The company is now looking for better, smarter ways to track performance, identifying customers to target with campaigns that promote new products or discounts. Oracle E-shop wants to use the comments/reviews from customers that have been posted on Tweeter and identify the customers who may cancel their premium card based on bad reviews (for example if they are far from warehouses they are willing to churn to avoid issues with shipping). Identifying influencers who post bad comments and giving them access to good promotions can help the company to retain its customers.  
Many of the scenarios in this workshop will very likely match the challenges you are seeing in your business and we hope the following labs and accompanying workshops will give you some insight into how Oracle can help you solve these common everyday business and technical challenges.
