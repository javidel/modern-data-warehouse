# Use Spatial to analyze tweets location


## Introduction

Oracle's spatial database is included in Oracle's converged database, allowing developers and analysts to get started easily with location intelligence analytics and mapping services. Organizations can manage different types of geospatial data, perform hundreds of spatial analytic operations, and use interactive map visualization tools with the spatial features in Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Database.

In this lab we are going to analyze the tweets location and compare them with our warehouses location to get new insights.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create warehouse table
* Create Spatial function to use latitude and longitude
* Query distance among users and warehouses


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have created the Autonomous Data Warehouse database in the previous lab.

## Task 1: Create Warehouse Table

## Task 2: Create Spatial function for latitude and longitude

## Task 3: Analyze distance using the location
