# Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure Workshop

![Intro Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure](./images/odsa.png)

## Introduction

The New Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure (ODSA) allows you to easily integrate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Database service into your Azure cloud environment. ODSA uses a service-based approach, and is an alternative to manually creating complex cross-cloud deployments for your application stacks.

Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure is an Oracle-managed service for Azure customers to easily provision, access, and operate enterprise-grade Oracle Database services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) with a familiar Azure-like experience. Users can seamlessly build Azure applications with the high performance, high availability, and automated management of Oracle Database services, such as Autonomous Database, running on OCI.

The service establishes low-latency connectivity between Microsoft Azure and OCI, deploys Oracle Database on OCI, and provides metrics on Azure. Customers can combine the full Azure catalog of AI and application services with OCIâ€™s most powerful database services. There are no charges for the interconnect ports or data ingress/egress over the interconnect. You will be billed normally for consumption of Oracle Database services like Autonomous Database.

- **Run your workloads where you choose**. Choose the best cloud provider for your applications and databases. Run mission-critical enterprise workloads across OCI and Microsoft Azure.

- **Build with Oracle on Azure**. Build new applications by combining Azure services with the high performance, high availability, and automated management of Oracle Database services on OCI.

- **Use fully managed Oracle databases**. Quickly and easily use Azure applications with highly available Oracle autonomous databases that provision, tune, secure, and scale.

- **OCI-exclusive database capabilities**. Use Oracle's Autonomous Database, Exadata Database Service, and Base Database Service with Real Application Clusters and other exclusive OCI capabilities.
