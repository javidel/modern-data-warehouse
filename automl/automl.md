# Predict Customer Churn with AutoML


## Introduction

Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI (OML AutoML UI) is a no-code user interface supporting automated machine learning for both data scientist productivity and non-expert user access to powerful in-database algorithms. Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI automates model building with minimal user input – you just have to specify the data and the target in what’s called an experiment and the tool does the rest. However, you can adjust some settings, such as the number of top models to select, the model selection metric, and even specific algorithms. Similarly, you can deploy models from OML AutoML UI as REST endpoints to Oracle Machine Learning (OML) Services in just a few clicks.

In this Lab we are going to use all the data we have for creating a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn or which customer could be a candidate to use our affinity card.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:


* Create a Machine Learning Model
* Store the Machine Learning model in Autonomous for running SQL with it.


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have created the Autonomous Data Warehouse database in the previous lab.

## Task 1: Prepare the data
## Task 2: Create the Model
## Task 3: Store the model inside the Autonomous Database
