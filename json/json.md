# Load JSON tweets in the Autonomous Database


## Introduction

Autonomous Database supports JSON data natively in the database. You can use NoSQL-style APIs to develop applications that use JSON document collections without needing to know SQL or how the documents are stored in the database.

In this Lab you are going to learn how to upload JSON data and how to run some queries over them.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a Object Storage bucket
* Upload JSON data
* Create Autonomous Credentials
* Query JSON data


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have created the Autonomous Data Warehouse database in the previous lab.

## Task 1: Upload JSON tweets into Object Storage

1. Once you have downloaded the JSON containing some tweets, we need to upload them into Object Storage. First we need to create a bucket.
Create Bucket, upload JSON
Create Credentials and Load JSON
Run Queries
